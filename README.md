# Solid Waste Detection Using Satellite Images

This project is a web application that uses Google's Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js to detect solid waste in satellite images.

## Description

This application loads a pre-trained Teachable Machine model and uses the webcam to capture live video. The model then makes predictions on the live video feed and displays the results in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codebrakerboy/solid-waste-detection-satellite-images.git
   cd solid-waste-detection-satellite-images
